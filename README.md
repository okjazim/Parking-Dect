# Parking-Dect
This project is a simple parking detection system built around the OX64. Peripheral devices such as the Raspberry Pi Pico 2  and the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to accurately detect the presence of vehicles in parking spaces are what have been integrated. Jumper wires are used to establish reliable connections between these components, ensuring efficient communication and operation. 

The system combines hardware interfacing and sensor data processing to provide a practical solution for automated parking management, utilizing the strengths of both the OX64 platform and the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 for enhanced control and flexibility. This setup is for demonstrating embedded system applications in real-world scenarios.
